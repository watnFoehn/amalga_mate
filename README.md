# Amalgamate

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Amalgamate is our second project during the nine week web dev bootcamp with Ironhack (Berlin). We had five days to build we and started after being in the bootcamp for five weeks.
It was developed in a team of three:

<h2> What is Amalgamate?</h2>

It is meant as an icebreaker for individuals of groups. Save some information about you (but you decide which one) and look for common interests. Then you can get in touch with other people and get to know them. See if they left an email address or just walk over and drink a coffee.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>


We used Express, node.js, MongoDB, mongoose, jquery and more to make this app work.
